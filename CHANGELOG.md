Release 0.1.1
=============

Changed to puppet-nodejs since puppetlabs/nodejs is now deprecated.

Release 0.1.0
=============

It now monitors for changes in the konfig files so we do not run the kongfig update if there is no changes.

Added support for ubuntu which installs kongfig in an alternative location.
